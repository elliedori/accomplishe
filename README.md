# WINNER â€“ SF LADY PROBLEMS HACKATHON 2016 (3rd Place)
Accomplishe is an app that helps women track their moments of success, power, and growth in the workplace so that they have a clear sense of what they bring to the table and feel more confident advocating for themselves. 

## The Problem

The goal of the Lady Problems hackathon is to build solutions for issues that women in tech face. Research shows that women are less likely to negotiate for a higher salary during a job offer, less likely to put themselves up for promotion, and much less likely to get venture capitalist funding than their male counterparts. Why is that?

The reason is two fold. Firstly, women are more likely to downplay their personal accomplishments in favor of promoting the team effort. Secondly, women are less likely to get direct encouragement to achieve their career goals.

## The Solution

Our team decided to build Accomplishe, an app that helps women track their moments of success, power, and growth in the workplace. The functionality is two-fold. Firstly, women enter their moments and choose a category. After they submit their moment, they see an inspirational quote from a powerful woman that ties back into the theme of that moment. For example, if it's a moment of growing through struggle, they may see an image of Michelle Obama with a quote from her explaining how struggle helps develop character and stretch. Lastly, women can review their accomplishments before a big moment, like that one year review or that VC funding pitch. Accomplishe enables women to have a clear sense of what they bring to the table, see their growth over time, and feel more confident advocating for themselves.
