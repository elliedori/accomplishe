Don't ever underestimate the importance you can have because history has shown us that courage can be contagious and hope can take on a life of its own.

When I worked with my old boss Larry, the market was pretty bad and he lost a lot of clients. He would get really emotional when his clients called in, but through that I learned to remain calm during high stress situations. Nothing phases me anymore. Before that, I would always be really panicky but after that I realized you have to remain calm in order to get out of it. // Ling

I used to work at an early stage startup and it was 75% all male employees, a really extreme work culture. It got to the point where all the executive males didn't acknowledge me. My colleagues that were also male, and when they finally left, the executives started acknowledging me – but just as an employee of the company, not acknowledging my work. I worked in marketing but they treated me like an assistant. I didn't feel valued whatsoever, and every time I brought up how I felt they delayed taking action and just let things be. I endured grunt work for a year. My moment of power was accepting that I'm much more valuable than I seem, stepping forward and quitting. At the time I wasn't as experienced and thought I'd learn so much if I stayed a little longer, but I just had to realize that I have to stick with my own choice and feel confident in my choices. That was the moment I really pivoted.  // Vivian

During a one to one, I told my manager that I was unhappy and wanted to work more on web applications instead of desktop apps. I was doing a lot of C# coding and wasn't happy with that area of coding. I told my manager and he brought it up to our CTO and I was able to switch projects and work on Angular. Even thought I was hired as a C# developer, because I spoke up I was able to switch team internally and work on something more interesting. Never be afraid to say what you want. I feel like it's easy to settle for something in your job, but never be afraid to know that you want to try something else an ask for it, even if it might not be totally feasible right at that moment. Just ask.  // Michelle

I was an office manager, so it's hard to quantify impact, but I got lots of great feedback because I would do so much event planning and office culture planning. It wasn't always big events, sometimes just being receptive to people's needs. If someone felt something was impacting them negatively, they would come to me so I could help. I got a lot of feedback about how empathic and receptive I was. The point of my job was to be a caring advocate for employees, and it was really rewarding to have that kind of impact on my colleagues.  // Ali

I was at a conference earlier this summer, and it's this huge conference with 40k people, and it's all men basically. I would say less than 1% were women. I've talked to this one woman and she was younger than me, and she was still starting out in her career, and she was asking me how to get ahead in the industry. She went to a coding camp to become a data analyst and the company that she works for had her updating excel spreadsheets and it just wasn't challenging her enough. She was kind of stuck in her job, and I don't think the company she worked for was really technical. I think she wanted some reassurance to find a job elsewhere. I told her it's difficult in tech, being one of the only women, and a lot of times you don't have the confidence that men tend to have. We just had this discussion that hasn't been had, or that needs to be done, to tell other women that it's okay if you're at a job that doesn't work out. It's okay to want more, not to feel like you're just stuck and this is as good as it's going to get. We just need to encourage women to talk about the real difficulties that they are having in their job, because I don't think that they're happy. I know there's a lot of company that have mentor program,s and I think that would help. Everything that I told her, I was like I need to listen to my own advice. I at that time had just changed jobs, and I had been with the same company for seven years, and I'd always see people coming and going. I felt like I had to be loyal, like I had this societal pressure to be like you have a good job, you have benefits, you don't need to want something bigger and better. I'm terrible at asking for raises, and my wife pressures me to do it, and it's always been for the best. She's like, the worst that they can say is no. They're not going to fire you, because you're a great employee. We just need to keep pushing each other and giving each other a boost. WHy do women feel like this? I know it goes back to childhood and how we're raised, and I think our parents raise us, society says oh you're a girl, you have to have manners, you have to be polite, and it's not enforced as much with boys. ANd this causes us to doubt everything – oh am I offending her oh am I asking too much? I am a girl, so I've only seen this one side. I think we have to change as a society I think we need to be cognizant of how we raise girls vs boys, so they don't feel like they have to be perfect or something like that. // Adrienne
